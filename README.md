#About this project
This is the project which came out as a result of following the tangowithdjango tutorials. I have not completely stuck to what they told me to make. I have made changes according to what I thought was better.

This project has been build using Python 2.7.6, Django 1.6.1, Jquery 2.1.4 and Bootstrap 2.3.2. I wanted to use the latest things (at the time of writing, this meant Python 3.4, Django 1.8 and Bootstrap 3.3.4) but I couldn't because tangowithdjango uses python 2.7 and django 1.5.4. I could have used newer bootstrap if I knew how to use it.
